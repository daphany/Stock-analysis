# Stock-analysis
Performing stock analysis on 12 stocks to compare their trading volume and rate of return in 2017 and 2018
## Overview of Project
Steve would like us to regractor the code in order to run the code in a more time efficient way.
find out what are the best performing green stocks for his parents by going through all the traing days in 2017 and 2018, and calculating the stock trading volumes and rate of return for 12 stocks.

## Result



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The number of successful outcome for the category of theatre is the highest in th month of May. Same as the number of failed outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Sucess rate and failure rate has an inverse relationship. Sucess rate is the highest when the goal is less than $1000 and is the lowest when the goal is around $45,000 to $49,999.

## Summary

- *What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?* \
Compare to other months, the period of May to August had the best outcome so it may be a good idea for Louise to start fundraising in this period; specifically, May is the best month to launch a fundraising project. 
In addition, the number of failed outcome is also the higest in this period which may due to the total number of outcomes.
The number of failed outcome is the highest in December. One possible reason is that people have lower budget because most money is spent on holidays including gifts, vacation, and dinners. As a result, its not recommeded to launch a campaign in December.

- *What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?* \
Louise is most likely to reach her goal if her goal amount is less than $1000. On the other hand, she is least likely to reach her goal when her goal amount is between $45,000 to $49,999.

- *What are some limitations of this dataset?*  
  1. There are many other factors which might affect the outcomes including number of fundraiser, their budgets and etc which none of it was considered in our dataset.
  2. Theatre Outcome Based on Launch Month: it is not fair to just compare the outcomes based on launch month since the total number of campaigns are different in each month.
- *What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?* \
Theatre Outcome Based on Launch Month: it might be more accurate to use a dual axis chart to illustrate the outcome based on launch month VS percentage of success/failsure.
