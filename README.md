# Stock-analysis
Performing stock analysis on 12 stocks to compare their trading volume and rate of return in 2017 and 2018
## Overview of Project
-Steve would like to find out what are the best performing green stocks for his parents by going through all the traing days in 2017 and 2018, and calculating the stock trading volumes and rate of return for 12 stocks.
-Steve is looking to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years so he would like us to regractor the code in order to run the code in a more time efficient way.

## Result



### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The number of successful outcome for the category of theatre is the highest in th month of May. Same as the number of failed outcomes.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Sucess rate and failure rate has an inverse relationship. Sucess rate is the highest when the goal is less than $1000 and is the lowest when the goal is around $45,000 to $49,999.

## Summary
Code refractoring is a way to restructure and optimize your existing design of code without changing its external behaviour. Refractoring has its advantage and disadvantage.

-Advantages: it can enhance exsiting code to make it more efficient and easier for humans to understand. It also increases the maintainability. \
-Disadvantages: it might be time consuming and more costly than rewriting the code from scratch thus making it more risky to do it. In addition, there might be new potential buds that might be introduced with code refractoring.

### Advantages and disadvantages of the original VBA scripts:
The original code is easier to understand for people who are new to VBA since its more straightforward;however, it took much longer to run then the refractored script.
### Advantages and disadvantages of the refractored VBA scripts:
In our project, with the refractored script, it decreases the time to run the program thus enabling Steve to expand the dataset and do more calculation of stocks in future; however, it took more time to actually refractor the code than writing the original code. In additional, more arrays were needed so its harder to understand.
